\section*{Abstract}
The growing adoption of \textbf{Electric Vehicles (EVs)} in embracing with the ever-increasing incursion of sporadic \textbf{Renewable Energy Sources (RES)} presents substantial challenges to the \textbf{stability} and \textbf{efficiency} of the power grid. \textbf{Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)} technology emerges as a key solution, transforming EVs from passive loads to \textbf{flexible energy resources} subject of providing assorted \textbf{grid services}. This thesis addresses the composite \textbf{multi-objective optimization problem} of smart EV charging and discharging management, which inherently involves a trade-off between \textbf{economic benefits}, \textbf{user mobility needs}, \textbf{battery health preservation}, and \textbf{grid stability} under stochastic conditions.
\\
Faced with the complex challenge of optimizing electric vehicle (EV) charging in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) scenarios, an approach limited to a single control model, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), would be insubstantial. The nature of the problem, characterized by multiple running afoul objectives (economic benefits, user needs, battery health, grid stability) and profound uncertainty, requires a rigorous comparative analysis of a all-embracing range of control strategies.
\\
For this argue, the research focuses on appraising \begin{comment} evaluating
\end{comment}
a diverse portfolio of algorithms, including numerous Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models, heuristic approaches, and Model Predictive Control (MPC). This method allows for a utter mapping of the solution landscape, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in relation to the different facets of the V2G problem.
\\
Briefly, this thesis does not concentrate on a single paradigm, but embraces a \textbf{broad-spectrum comparative perspective} because:
\\
\textbf{There is no universal remedy}: The intricacy of the V2G challenge makes it improbable that one algorithm will prove superior across all circumstances.
\\
\textbf{We pursue equilibria}: The objective is to unveil the balances between data thriftiness, learning steadiness, resilience to unpredictability, and computational burden across diverse algorithmic families.
\\
\textbf{Assessment is more stringent}: Juxtaposing DRL frameworks not only among themselves but also against established references such as heuristics and MPC yields a far more trustworthy appraisal of their genuine incremental merit.
