\section*{Abstract}
The growing adoption of \textbf{Electric Vehicles (EVs)}, combined with the increasing penetration of intermittent \textbf{Renewable Energy Sources (RES)}, presents significant challenges to the \textbf{stability} and \textbf{efficiency} of the power grid~\footcite{Tavakoli2019}. \textbf{Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)} technology emerges as a key solution, transforming EVs from passive loads into \textbf{flexible energy resources} capable of providing various \textbf{grid services}. This thesis addresses the complex \textbf{multi-objective optimization problem} of smart EV charging and discharging, which requires balancing \textbf{economic benefits}, \textbf{user mobility needs}, \textbf{battery health preservation}, and \textbf{grid stability} under stochastic conditions.
\\
Given the complexity of optimizing EV charging in V2G scenarios, relying on a single control model is insufficient. The nature of the problem, characterized by multiple conflicting objectives (economic benefits, user needs, battery health, grid stability) and profound uncertainty, demands a rigorous comparative analysis of a wide range of control strategies.
\\
For this reason, the research focuses on evaluating a diverse portfolio of algorithms, including numerous Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models, heuristic approaches, and Model Predictive Control (MPC). This method allows for a complete mapping of the solution landscape, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in relation to the different facets of the V2G problem.
\\
In short, this thesis adopts a \textbf{broad-spectrum comparative approach} for several reasons:
\\
\textbf{No Single Solution}: The complexity of the V2G problem makes it unlikely that a single algorithm can be optimal in all conditions.
\\
\textbf{Understanding Trade-offs}: The goal is to understand the trade-offs between data efficiency, training stability, robustness to uncertainty, and the computational complexity of different algorithm families.
\\
\textbf{Rigorous Validation}: Comparing DRL models not only against each other but also against established benchmarks like heuristics and MPC provides a more credible measure of their true value.
